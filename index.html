    <h2>About Me</h2>
    I am currently a fourth-year PhD student in computer science at UCLA. I'm co-advised by Prof. Chuang Gan from MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Prof. Song-Chun Zhu and Prof. Ying Nian Wu from UCLA. Previously, I was an undergraduate in the Department of Electrical Engineering in Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by <a href="http://iwct.sjtu.edu.cn/Personal/xwang8/index.html">Prof. Xinbing Wang</a> and <a href="http://wnzhang.net/">Prof. Weinan Zhang</a>. <br><br>My main focus lies in <strong>3D reasoning</strong>, especially about the perspectives that go beyond pattern recognition in 2D images and need to be reasoned in the 3D space, including physics, functionality etc. I'm also interested in concept learning and structure learning, which are crucial aspects of visual reasoning in the 3D space.<br>
  <br>  
<!--   Iâ€™ve been drawing inspiration from cognitive science, and endowing machines with human-like concept learning abilities via neural-graphical-symbolic learning. Specifically:<br>
    <strong>Neural</strong>: neural networks for natural language processing and computer vision. <br>
    <strong>Graphical</strong>: graph parsing via grammar learning. <br>
    <strong>Symbolic</strong>: symbolic reasoning, including program synthesis, inductive logic programming and theorem proving. -->
  <!--     My research interest lies in Neural-Symbolic Learning, Mathematical Reasoning and Program Synthesis, particularly in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. -->

    <h2>Misc.</h2>
    Outside of research, I'm a multi-instrumentalist. I play the piano, pipa (a Chinese instrument), and harpsichord in an orchestra; the pipe organ in a local church; the keyboard and guitar in a rock band. I also occasionally play the saxophone and melodica (highly underrated instrument!) in casual jazz jams. (Favorite music genres: metal, rock, jazz, classic. <a href="https://pleasekillme.com/">Favorite book.</a>)<br><br>
    I've been playing the piano since I was five, and I was the president of the piano association in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 
    I really enjoy playing double-piano works with others (In fact I held a double-piano concert when I was an undergraduate!). <br><br>
