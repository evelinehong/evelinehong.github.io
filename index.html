    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ee448-2018-text-classification/leaderboard"><strong>Text classification Kaggle Competition</strong></a> <br>
    Ranked <strong>1st</strong> in public leaderboard, <strong>2nd</strong> in private. <strong>Best Presentation Award</strong> in the poster session.<br>
    Trained classification models to predict the categories of Chinese texts. Applied Text-CNN, Xgboost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes as basic models. <br>
    Implemented some <strong>ensembling</strong> above these models using techniques such as parameter disturbances, 1/rank weighted mean and rank weighted mean.<br>

    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ee448-2018-text-classification/leaderboard"><strong>Link Prediction Kaggle Competition</strong></a> <br>
    Applied, compared and ensembled two models: TransE and Node2Vec to analyze the possible attributes of entities to infer missing links in an observed academic knowledge graph.
     <br><br>

    <strong>Classify CIFAR-10 $\&$ MNIST Datasats through Different Classifiers</strong><br>
    Ranked <strong>1st</strong> among 163 undergraduates.<br>
    Introduced and implemented different machine learning classifiers: KNN, Linear SVM, Kernel SVM, Fisher’s Linear Discriminant and Kernel Fisher Discriminant on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.<br>
    Compared the advantages and disadvantages with regard to accuracy, easiness to implement, training and testing time, memory requirement and etc.<br><br>

    <strong>Comparisons for Multilayer Perceptron on MNIST Dataset</strong><br>
    Ranked <strong>1st</strong> among 163 undergraduates.<br>
    Implemented a neural network with one hidden layer. <br>
    Compared the training results using different activation functions, optimization algorithms, hyperparameters and gradient descent techniques.<br>
    Visualized the results with regard to MSE, classification accuracy.<br><br>

    <strong>File Transfer Application Based on Wi-Fi Direct</strong><br>
    Developed a file transfer application based on Wi-Fi Direct to implement the file sharing between Android and PC terminal without wireless network.<br>
    Realized the device discovering and connection by Wi-Fi Direct, implemented the bidirectional send-and-receive function through socket communication and extended the group sending function at Android terminal.<br>
    Based on Universal Windows Platform, applied C# to realize the handshake and file transfer function at PC terminal, and also, between PC terminal and Android terminal.
